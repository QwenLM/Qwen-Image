## Introduction
We are thrilled to release **Qwen-Image**, a 20B MMDiT image foundation model that achieves significant advances in **complex text rendering** and **precise image editing**. Experiments show strong general capabilities in both image generation and editing, with exceptional performance in text rendering, especially for Chinese.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)

2. Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": "Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": "超清，4K，电影级构图" # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "通义千问". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "π≈3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Low RAM Inference

For systems with limited RAM, you can use the following optimized setup that includes 8-bit quantization and CPU offloading:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import QwenImagePipeline
from transformers import Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration
from diffusers.models import QwenImageTransformer2DModel
from torchao.quantization import quantize_, Float8WeightOnlyConfig

dtype = torch.bfloat16
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

text_encoder = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct", 
    torch_dtype=dtype,
    device_map="auto"
)
quantize_(text_encoder, Float8WeightOnlyConfig())

transformer = QwenImageTransformer2DModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen-Image", 
    subfolder="transformer", 
    torch_dtype=dtype,
    device_map="auto"
)
quantize_(transformer, Float8WeightOnlyConfig())

pipe = QwenImagePipeline.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen-Image",
    text_encoder=text_encoder,
    transformer=transformer,
    torch_dtype=dtype,
    device_map="auto"
)

pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = "A beautiful sunset over mountains, photorealistic style"
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt="text, watermark, copyright, blurry, low resolution",
    width=1024,
    height=1024,
    num_inference_steps=30,  
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    guidance_scale=1.0
).images[0]

image.save("low_ram_output.png")
```

## Show Cases

One of its standout capabilities is high-fidelity text rendering across diverse images. Whether it's alphabetic languages like English or logographic scripts like Chinese, Qwen-Image preserves typographic details, layout coherence, and contextual harmony with stunning accuracy. Text isn't just overlaid, it's seamlessly integrated into the visual fabric.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s1.jpg#center)

Beyond text, Qwen-Image excels at general image generation with support for a wide range of artistic styles. From photorealistic scenes to impressionist paintings, from anime aesthetics to minimalist design, the model adapts fluidly to creative prompts, making it a versatile tool for artists, designers, and storytellers.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s2.jpg#center)

When it comes to image editing, Qwen-Image goes far beyond simple adjustments. It enables advanced operations such as style transfer, object insertion or removal, detail enhancement, text editing within images, and even human pose manipulation—all with intuitive input and coherent output. This level of control brings professional-grade editing within reach of everyday users.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s3.jpg#center)

But Qwen-Image doesn't just create or edit, it understands. It supports a suite of image understanding tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, depth and edge (Canny) estimation, novel view synthesis, and super-resolution. These capabilities, while technically distinct, can all be seen as specialized forms of intelligent image editing, powered by deep visual comprehension.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s4.jpg#center)

Together, these features make Qwen-Image not just a tool for generating pretty pictures, but a comprehensive foundation model for intelligent visual creation and manipulation—where language, layout, and imagery converge.

### Advanced Usage

#### Prompt Enhance
For enhanced prompt optimization and multi-language support, we recommend using our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-Plus .

You can integrate it directly into your code:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
prompt = rewrite(prompt)
```

Alternatively, run the example script from the command line:

```bash
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
```


## Deploy Qwen-Image

Qwen-Image supports Multi-GPU API Server for local deployment:

### Multi-GPU API Server Pipeline & Usage

The Multi-GPU API Server will start a Gradio-based web interface with:
- Multi-GPU parallel processing
- Queue management for high concurrency
- Automatic prompt optimization
- Support for multiple aspect ratios

Configuration via environment variables:
```bash
export NUM_GPUS_TO_USE=4          # Number of GPUs to use
export TASK_QUEUE_SIZE=100        # Task queue size
export TASK_TIMEOUT=300           # Task timeout in seconds
```

```bash
# Start the gradio demo server, api key for prompt enhance
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/demo.py 
```


## AI Arena

To comprehensively evaluate the general image generation capabilities of Qwen-Image and objectively compare it with state-of-the-art closed-source APIs, we introduce [AI Arena](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com), an open benchmarking platform built on the Elo rating system. AI Arena provides a fair, transparent, and dynamic environment for model evaluation.

In each round, two images—generated by randomly selected models from the same prompt—are anonymously presented to users for pairwise comparison. Users vote for the better image, and the results are used to update both personal and global leaderboards via the Elo algorithm, enabling developers, researchers, and the public to assess model performance in a robust and data-driven way. AI Arena is now publicly available, welcoming everyone to participate in model evaluations.

The latest leaderboard rankings can be viewed at [AI Arena Learboard](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com/corpora/arena/leaderboard?arenaType=text2image)

If you wish to deploy your model on AI Arena and participate in the evaluation, please contact weiyue.wy@alibaba-inc.com.
